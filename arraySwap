// write a function named arraySwap 
// that takes an array of integers as input
// and return a new array where, starting from 0, the value of i position
// and the value of i + 1 position are inverted in their position

// for example: with [5, 6] it would return [6, 5]
// for example: with [1, 2, 3, 4] it would return [2, 1, 4, 3]
// for example: with [7, 8, 9] it would return [8, 7, 9] because '9' can't
// be swapped with anything else as the array is finished.
